# Node.js-MySQL

This is a store-front/inventory mock up using Node.js and MySQL.

Running the app in the node terminal will automatically provide a list of all the products for sale.

*   You will recieve a prompt to:
    1. Enter in the item ID you want.
    2. Enter in the quantity amount.
    3. Your total will be summed up and the app will end.

Each time you order an item, the database will be updated to the correct amount of inventory available for purchase.  If it is sold out or there isn't enough, the app will alert you.
